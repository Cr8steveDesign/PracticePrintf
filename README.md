# Collaboration Practice: ALX Software Engineering 
## The Re-Birth of the printf function in the C Programming Language

### Collaborators: 
- `Stephen Omoregie: @Cr8SteveDesign`
- `Favour: @callmeKORRA03`

### Files
- `test-main.c` <br>
    This file will contain various test cases for the custom functions we will be creating towards the implementation of the prinf function. <br>

- `_printf.c` <br>
    This file will contain the major logic for implementing the printf function. It will technically be the mother-ship for the other sub-functions that will be called based on different use. 
- `_switchCaseFnc.c` <br>
    We will have to implement either an if-else or switch (case) conditional to test for the various format specifiers. This will help reduce the lines of our code and make it more modular and maintainable.

#### As we will not be using any of the stdio.h library functions. We'll be implementing all other output functions that will be required by the printf.

These functions are implemented in the following files (as named): 
- `_putchar.c`<br>
    Function for writing characters to stdout.
- `_puts.c`<br>
    Function for writing strings to stdout.
- `_printint.c`<br>
    Function for printing out integers to stdout.
- `_printhex.c`<br>
    Function for printing out hexadecimal values
